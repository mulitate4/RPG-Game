# rpg_game
An RPG-game I've been working on in pure python.
This game features a map, which is made using array-backed grids, and a turn based RPG game!

This project will soon be hosted on a website using django, js, html, and css :D

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, contact me on discord, if you find any bugs
